'''
Todo:
collect data from input.txt into a nested list/2d array [[row data],[row data], ....]
input txt must be in current working directory.

Wite a function that takes a nested list of any size and determines if there are multiples
of any number, either in the row or the column

Will need to look up:
open, close, split, append

refresher:
myList = [a,b, [c, d]]
mylist[0] = a
mylist[1] = b
mylist[2] = [c, d]
mylist[2][0] = c
